Revision history for Perl extension Class-MOP.

0.12 Thurs. Feb 23, 2006
    - reduced the dependency on B, no need to always 
      have the latest

    * examples/
      - added docs to the C3 method dispatch order test
      - fixed missing Algorithm::C3 dependency by making 
        the test skip if it is not installed

0.11 Mon Feb. 20, 2006
    * examples/
      - added example of changing method dispatch order to C3
      
    * Class::MOP::Class
      - changed how clone_instance behaves, it now only does a
        shallow clone (see docs for more details)
        - added docs and tests

0.10 Tues Feb. 14, 2006
    ** This release was mostly about writing more tests and 
       cleaning out old and dusty code, the MOP should now 
       be considered "ready to use".

    - adding more tests to get coverage up a little higher,
      mostly testing errors and edge cases.
      - test coverage is now at 99%
      
    * Class::MOP
      - no longer optionally exports to UNIVERSAL::meta or
        creates a custom metaclass generator, use the 
        metaclass pragma instead.

    * Class::MOP::Class  
      - fixed a number of minor issues which came up in the 
        error/edge-case tests
        
    * Class::MOP::Attribute 
      - fixed a number of minor issues which came up in the 
        error/edge-case tests        
     
    * examples/
      - fixing the AttributesWithHistory example, it was broken.

0.06 Thurs Feb. 9, 2006
    * metaclass
      - adding new metaclass pragma to make setting up the 
        metaclass a little more straightforward
        
    * Class::MOP
      - clean up bootstrapping to include more complete 
        attribute definitions for Class::MOP::Class and 
        Class::MOP::Attribute (accessors, readers, writers, 
        etc.) ... it is redundant, but is useful meta-info
        to have around.

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - fixing minor meta-circularity issue with &meta, it 
        is now more useful for subclasses
      - added &get_attribute_map as an accessor for the 
        hash of attribute meta objects
      - &compute_all_applicable_attributes now just returns
        the attribute meta-object, rather than the HASH ref
        since all the same info can be gotten from the 
        attribute meta-object itself
          - updated docs & tests to reflect
      - added &clone_instance method which does a deep clone
        of the instance structure created by &construct_instance
          - added docs & tests for this
          - added Clone as a dependency
      - added &new_object and &clone_object convience methods to
        return blessed new or cloned instances
          - they handle Class::MOP::Class singletons correctly too
          - added docs & tests for this
      - cleaned up the &constuct_class_instance so that it behaves
        more like &construct_instance (and managed the singletons too)
      - added the &check_metaclass_compatibility method to make sure
        that metaclasses are upward and downward compatible.
          - added tests and docs for this
          
    * examples/
      - adjusting code to use the &Class::MOP::Class::meta
        fix detailed above
      - adjusting code to use the metaclass pragma
      
0.05 Sat Feb. 4, 2006
    * Class::MOP::Class
      - added the &attribute_metaclass and &method_metaclass
        attributes which contain a metaclass name to use for 
        attributes/methods respectively
    
    * Class::MOP
      - bootstrap additional attributes for Class::MOP::Class 
        
    * examples/
      - adjusted the example code and tests to use the new
        &attribute_metaclass feature of Class::MOP::Class
      - added new example:
        - LazyClass

0.04 Fri Feb. 3, 2006
    * Class::MOP::Class
      - some documentation suggestions from #perl6
    
    * Class::MOP::Attribute
      - improved error messages    
    
    * examples/
      - added new examples:
        - AttributesWithHistory
        - ClassEncapsultedAttributes

0.03 Fri Feb. 3, 2006
    - converted to Module::Build instead of EU::MM
    
    * Class::MOP::Attribute
      - refactored method generation code
      - attributes are now associated with class directly
    
    * examples/
      - refactored the InsideOut example to take advantage 
        of the Class::MOP::Attribute refactoring
      - changed example files to .pod files and hide thier
        package names from PAUSE (I don't want to own these
        namespaces really, they are just examples)

0.02 Thurs Feb. 2, 2006
    - moving examples from t/lib/* to examples/*
        - adding POD documentation to the examples
