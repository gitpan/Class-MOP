by C<Class::MOP::Method::Accessor> and C<Class::MOP::Method::Constructor>.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<new (%options)>

This creates the method based on the criteria in C<%options>, 
these options are:

=over 4

=item I<is_inline>

This is a boolean to indicate if the method should be generated
as a closure, or as a more optimized inline version.
